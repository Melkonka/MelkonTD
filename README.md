This is a learning project aiming to learn Rust.

I use the Amethyst game engine.

The project's scope is not yet decided, it can be anything in this range:
- Simple desktop Tower defense/Anti-tower defense
- Some more advanced TD/AntiTD for android/ios/browser.
- Multiplayer tower war with matchmaking and all the shiny stuff.
